# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Network

This project implements a simple yet effective **Neural Network** using **TensorFlow** to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It's a great introductory project for understanding how deep learning models handle image classification tasks.

## 🗂️ Features

- Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale digit images
- Achieves high accuracy with a simple architecture
- Visualizes predictions and training metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
